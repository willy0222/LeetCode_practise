| 5            | 2020-03-01   | 50       |
+--------------+--------------+----------+
Output: 
+--------------------+---------+
| product_name       | unit    |
+--------------------+---------+
| Leetcode Solutions | 130     |
| Leetcode Kit       | 100     |
+--------------------+---------+
```
Explanation: 
Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select product_name, sum(unit) as unit
from Products as p left join Orders as o
on p.product_id = o.product_id
where month(order_date) = 2 and year(order_date) = 2020
group by product_name
having sum(unit) >= 100
```
