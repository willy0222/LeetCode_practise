Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```sql
Input: 
Employees table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
EmployeeUNI table:
+----+-----------+
| id | unique_id |
+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |
+-----------+----------+
```
Explanation: 
Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, We will show null instead.
The unique ID of Meir is 2.
The unique ID of Winston is 3.
The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.


```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select unique_id, name
from Employees as e left join EmployeeUNI as u
on e.id = u.id
```
