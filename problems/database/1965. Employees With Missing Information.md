Write a solution to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:

The employee's name is missing, or

# Write your MySQL query statement below
-- 找出在Employees表中有但在Salaries表中没有的
SELECT e.employee_id
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE s.employee_id IS NULL

UNION

-- 找出在Salaries表中有但在Employees表中没有的

LEFT JOIN Employees e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL

ORDER BY employee_id;
```
