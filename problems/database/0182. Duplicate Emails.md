Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```sql
Input: 
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select email as Email
from Person
group by email
having count(email) > 1
```
