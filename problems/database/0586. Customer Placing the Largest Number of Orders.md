Write a solution to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.
```
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select customer_number
from orders
group by customer_number
order by count(customer_number) desc -- 按每個分組的記錄數（訂單數量）降序排序，訂單最多的客戶排在最前面
limit 1                   -- 限制結果只返回一條記錄，即訂單數量最多的客戶
```
