Write a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```sql
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Output: 
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```
Explanation: Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a.name as Employee
from Employee
as a join Employee as b
on a.managerId = b.id
and a.salary > b.salary
```
